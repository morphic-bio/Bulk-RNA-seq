# Awk Script Output Handling Errors (2025-05-26 01:06:42)

Looks like there is an error in the awk statement "/data/filterChrY.sh: line 60:  outputFileY;

The linter errors in your `awk` script point to problematic ways of handling output redirection, especially when combined with `awk`'s pipe feature (`print | command`).

1.  `ycmd = "gzip > " outputFileY;` (for gzipped files): When used as `print | ycmd`, `awk` tries to pipe to the command string `"gzip > filename"`. While this might sometimes work by invoking a shell, linters flag it because `gzip > filename` is a shell construct involving redirection, not just a simple command that reads from stdin. The redirection `>` within the command string can be seen as competing with `awk`'s own pipe `|`.
2.  `ycmd = "> " outputFileY;` (for non-gzipped files): This is incorrect. `"> filename"` is not a command. `print | "> filename"` would instruct `awk` to pipe output to a non-existent command named `>` with `filename` as an argument, which is not the intent. For direct file output, `awk` uses `print > filename`.

The fix involves:
*   Using `print > filename_variable` for direct, non-gzipped output to `outputFileY`.
*   For gzipped output, constructing a proper shell command string like `"gzip -c > \"filename_variable\""` and using `print | command_string_variable`. The `gzip -c` part makes `gzip` output to stdout, and the `> \"filename\"` part is a standard shell redirection handled by the shell that `awk` invokes for the pipe.
*   A helper variable `y_destination_string` will store either the filename (for direct output) or the full command string (for piped gzipped output).
*   The `close()` function in the `END` block will use this same `y_destination_string`.
*   Added `close(ynamesFile);` in the `BEGIN` block as good practice after reading the file.

These changes make the `awk` script's output handling more robust and should resolve the linter errors.
